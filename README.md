### Hi there :alien:

I'm Gabriela (but you can call me Gabs), I'm from Brazil and in love about tech. For you to know me better, I'll briefly tell about my decision to change completely my carrier.
> Recently I have made a big choice in my professional life: I decided to change my chemistry research carrier to the IT world. Since I got into the university, my biggest plan
> was to become a researcher and an academic professor because of my desire to make peopleâ€™s lives better. Unfortunately, the recent challenges in the science field in Brazil made > me feel demotivated about the whole scenario, and because of that, I chose to put my ongoing doctor degree aside. Then, I realized that I could still contribute to the community in other fields. So, I started to study and practice web development and now I feel more motivated to keep learning and working in this new field. For now, I'm working with Vue.js!


#### ðŸŒ± 2020 Goals

Continue learning React.js, specially TypeScript and Styled Components. I'm really curious about database to create an API to improve my skills in building something like an e-commerce. Also, I'll improve my first project that shows every element information by clicking it on periodic table. 

#### âš¡ Fun fact

I love cats (have two :smiley_cat:), music, games and I have a twin sister.
